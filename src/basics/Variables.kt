    There are two main keywords to define variables, 'val' and 'var'.

    the one that can be modified.

    In Kotlin you can omit the types of variables and the compiler will infer the types for you.

    /*
    Kotlin is a statically-typed language, which means that every variable, every expression has a type.
    Even if you omit the type, the compiler just infers it for you.
    It doesn't mean that this variable doesn't have a type or it's unknown. It means that the type specification is verbose, itâ€™s clear from the context, and you trust the compiler to infer the type.

    /*
    Is it possible to modify an object stored in 'val'?
    If we're talking about reference types, in Kotlin as in Java, variables just refer to some objects stored in memory.
    And this question can be reworded as: Does 'val' put any additional constraints on the stored object?

    Answer: There are no additional constraints. You can easily modify an object stored in 'val', as in Java. 'val',
    like a 'final' variable, is an immutable reference which doesn't say anything about the content that is stored.
